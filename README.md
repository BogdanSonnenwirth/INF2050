This code strictly belongs to Bogdan Sonnenwirth and is simply presented for educational purposes only.

This is an old university project of mine that I worked on during a whole semester. There have been 3 incremental steps that has led to the final version of the code. Each of these steps either overlap or encapsulate one another. The details of the project are in French, but essentially, this code is a Java project used with Maven that allows users to calculate their insurance deductions.
